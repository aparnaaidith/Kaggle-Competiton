  ## 1. Logistic Regression Model(https://github.com/aparnaaidith/Kaggle-Competiton/blob/master/Find%20the%20secret%20binary%20outcome%20-%20using%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)
   ### What is Logistic Regression?
   Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary).    Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe      data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or      ratio-level independent variables.
   
   ### Assumptions in Logistic Regression :
   Any logistic regression example in Python is incomplete without addressing model assumptions in the analysis. The important    assumptions of the logistic regression model include:

   1. Target variable is binary
   2. Predictive features are interval (continuous) or categorical
   3. Features are independent of one another
   4. Sample size is adequate – Rule of thumb: 50 records per predictor
  ## 2. Linear Regression Model(https://github.com/aparnaaidith/Kaggle-Competiton/blob/master/Find%20the%20secret%20binary%20outcome%20-%20using%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb)
  ### What is Linear Regression?
  Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis.  The overall idea of regression is to examine     two things: 
  (1) does a set of predictor variables do a good job in predicting an outcome (dependent) variable?  
  (2) Which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variable, and in what way do they–indicated by      the magnitude and sign of the beta estimates–impact the outcome variable?  
  
  These regression estimates are used to explain therelationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent     variables.The simplest form of the regression equation with one dependent and one independent variable is defined by the       formula y = c + b*x, where y = estimated dependent variable score, c = constant, b = regression coefficient, and x = score     on the independent variable.
