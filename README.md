   ### What is Logistic Regression?
   Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary).    Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe      data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or      ratio-level independent variables.
   
   ### Assumptions in Logistic Regression :
   Any logistic regression example in Python is incomplete without addressing model assumptions in the analysis. The important    assumptions of the logistic regression model include:

   1. Target variable is binary
   2. Predictive features are interval (continuous) or categorical
   3. Features are independent of one another
   4. Sample size is adequate â€“ Rule of thumb: 50 records per predictor
